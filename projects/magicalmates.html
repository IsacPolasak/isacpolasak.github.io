                                whom the persona is based on – a nurse and mom of a five-year-old – shared how difficult it was to maintain a consistent bedtime routine when she worked late shifts. She 
                                wanted a comforting, familiar presence her child could rely on, even when she couldn’t be there in person.</p>

                                From discovering the app and connecting the plush toy, to recording, organizing, and sending personalized messages, the process supports building comforting routines. There 
                                are several opportunities to improve usability, such as adding onboarding tutorials, enabling message previews and re-recording, organizing messages into folders, and allowing

                        <p>When I started sketching, I wasn’t aiming for a perfect layout. I just wanted to get ideas out quickly 
                            and see what stuck. For each page, I created a few different versions, each with its own approach to 
                            layout, flow, or interaction. Then I went back through and highlighted the parts that felt the strongest, 
                            whether a layout that made navigation smoother or a feature that directly addressed a user pain point. I 
                            treated it like a mix-and-match process, pulling my favorite elements into one refined concept. The accompanying 
                            figure shows this for the Favorites page, where I starred the pieces that felt the most important, and combined 
                            them into the version I later used in my wireframe.</p>

                        <p>When I started sketching, my goal wasn’t perfection. It was to get ideas down and see what clicked. I created a few 
                            versions of each page, each exploring different layouts and flows. Then I highlighted the strongest elements on each page and 
                            combined them into a refined concept. The accompanying figure shows this process for the Favorite Audios page, where I starred the 
                            key pieces and merged them into the version that became part of my wireframe.</p>

                        <p>After sketching out a paper wireframe I was happy with, I started building a digital version. 
                        This helped me clean things up, get a better feel for spacing and flow, and bring the layout 
                        closer to how it might actually look on a screen.</p>

                            <p id="lowfi-paragraph-one">After finalizing the wireframes, I began connecting everything in Figma to map out the main user flows. 
                                I focused on two of the core actions: broadcasting a message and creating or broadcasting a story. These flows were central to 
                                the experience, so mapping them out early helped me see how users would move through the app and where any friction might occur.</p>
                            <p id="lowfi-paragraph-two">While building the low-fidelity prototype, I kept the layout minimal and the navigation straightforward, 
                                making sure each step in both flows connected smoothly. Since visuals and content were still in progress, I prioritized structure 
                                and usability to ensure the foundation was solid before layering on detail.</p>

                            <p>When moving from the low-fidelity to the high-fidelity prototype, I focused on reorganizing certain 
                                structures, especially around the story creation flow. Based on feedback from the usability study, 
                                I realized I had initially overlooked features such as previously played stories, so I incorporated 
                                that into the high-fidelity version. I also added details such as age range and other contextual information 
                                to make each story more tailored and informative. These updates helped create a more complete and intuitive 
                                experience that better reflected real user needs.</p>

                                Users also wanted previously played stories, which was added as well, as well as some other non-major changes

                            <p><strong>The second</strong> usability study proved the need for age ranges in stories, and an easier way

                            broadcasting a message and creating or broadcasting a story — functioned in practice. I observed participants as 
                            they navigated through key tasks, noting where the structure supported their expectations and where it caused confusion. 
                            Feedback highlighted that much of the functionality felt intuitive. Another emphasized how design choices, such as color 
                            helped reinforce clarity. Additional feedback was taken in order to help polish and tidy up the high-fidelity prototype.</p>

                                learning how to create custom icons that matched the tone of the app. Lastly, I also gained a better sense of how to balance creativity with usability, making sure every design choice served a clear purpose.
