                                    and lunch. During peak hours, long lines and rushed customers make it difficult to customize orders. 
                                    Staff often feel overwhelmed explaining menu items, and customers don’t have time to wait or 
                                    ask questions. Patrons just want to order ahead and grab their food on the go.

                                    <p><strong>Before conducting research,</strong> I assumed that the typical bakery customers were busy adults who valued high-quality, affordable food they couldn’t easily make at home, often grabbing breakfast or lunch on the go.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Through user interviews and observation,</strong> I found that most customers were professionals with demanding routines who didn’t have time to wait in long lines or customize orders on the spot. Many expressed frustration during peak hours and wanted a quicker, more convenient way to place their usual orders.</p>
                                    <p><strong>In speaking with staff,</strong> I saw how overwhelming the morning rush could be. They often had to explain menu items and manage custom orders under pressure, slowing service and adding stress. These insights revealed a shared pain point: the need for a system that shortens waits and makes mornings easier for everyone.</p>

                            It’s the first impression and a key factor in encouraging users to engage with the app. I explored 
                            several variations, experimenting with layout, hierarchy, and content. For each version, I starred 
                            elements that resonated most, whether it was the structure, visual flow, or clarity of information. 
                            I then combined these strongest aspects into a final paper wireframe, creating a homepage that 
                            balanced functionality with a welcoming and intuitive design.</p>

                            <p id="lowfi-paragraph-one">After finalizing the wireframes, I started linking everything together in Figma to map out the main user flow.
                            I focused on the checkout process: how someone would add something to their cart and actually complete an order.
                            It was a simple way to test how the screens worked together and whether the flow made sense before moving on to any visuals or details.</p>
                            <p id="lowfi-paragraph-two">
                            While building the low-fidelity prototype, I focused on keeping the layout simple and the navigation clear, making
                            sure all the key screens connected logically. Since the design was still basic, I concentrated on structure and user
                            flow rather than visuals or detailed content, which helped keep the focus on functionality first.</p>

                            <p>When creating the high-fidelity prototype, I built on everything I learned from the low-fidelity version and the usability feedback it generated. I revisited each screen with fresh eyes, making changes to the flow, visuals, and microcopy. I incorporated real images, colors, and branding elements, and added more visual hierarchy to key elements. The high-fidelity prototype became a more realistic version of the final product, allowing me to test not just functionality, but how the design felt in a real-world context.</p>

                            <p><strong>The first</strong> prototype did not include a full menu, and users found that confusing. After the usability study, I
                            decided to add a full menu option as well, so users can see everything the bakery has to offer on one page.</p>
                            <p><strong>The second</strong> usability study revealed the difficulty in customizations when the font become too small, which makes
                            the customization process more difficult. I redesigned the selection process to be a dropdown menu.</p>

                        <p>After building the high-fidelity prototype, I tested it with several users to see how well the flow held up in real-world use. I asked participants 
                        to go through key tasks like placing an order or checking out, and I paid close attention to where they hesitated or got confused. Some feedback 
                        confirmed things were working well, while other parts, like button placement or unclear labels, needed refining. These testing sessions helped me 
                        catch small usability issues I might have missed on my own, and they shaped the final tweaks I made before wrapping up the design.</p>
