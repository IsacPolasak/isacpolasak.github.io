                                    and lunch. During peak hours, long lines and rushed customers make it difficult to customize orders. 
                                    Staff often feel overwhelmed explaining menu items, and customers don’t have time to wait or 
                                    ask questions. Patrons just want to order ahead and grab their food on the go.</strong>

                            <p><strong>Before conducting research,</strong> I assumed that the typical bakery customers were busy adults who valued high-quality, affordable food they couldn’t easily make at home, often grabbing breakfast or lunch on the go.</p>
                            <p><strong>Through user interviews and observation,</strong> I confirmed that most customers were professionals with demanding morning routines who didn’t have time to wait in long lines or to customize orders on the spot. Many expressed frustration over delays during peak hours and wished for a quicker, more convenient way to place their usual orders.</p>
                            <p><strong>In speaking with staff,</strong> I also discovered how overwhelming the morning rush could be. They often had to repeatedly explain menu items and handle custom orders under pressure, which slowed down service and increased stress. These insights highlighted a shared pain point between customers and staff: a system that would reduce wait times by alleviating stress on both ends, and making mornings smoother for everyone.</p>

                                in-person ordering during high-traffic times. Customers are often in a rush and don’t have time to 
                                customize their meals on the spot, while staff members are overwhelmed by the volume of orders and constant 
                                need to clarify menu items. This dual frustration results in long lines, slower service, and stress for everyone involved.</p>

                                <p><strong>From my user interviews,</strong> I found a recurring theme among customers: time pressure, picky eaters, and the challenge of ordering food 
                                    that fits everyone’s preferences, especially in the morning. Many parents, particularly moms, mentioned how stressful it can be to 
                                    juggle their children’s food needs with their tight schedules. One of these users inspired the persona of Samantha.</p>
                                <p>Samantha is a busy mom of two who juggles school drop-offs, work, and errands, and all before 9 am. Her kids are picky eaters, 
                                    and while she wants them to eat something filling and nutritious before school, ordering breakfast is often a time-consuming 
                                    struggle. She gets frustrated when places don’t allow for quick customization or when she has to wait in long lines during peak 
                                    hours. Samantha values speed, flexibility, and the ability to order ahead without needing to explain everything in person. While 
                                    she doesn’t consider herself a “techy” person, she’s open to solutions that genuinely make her hectic mornings easier.</p>

                        <p>To begin ideating, I reflected on the insights from my research and interviews, 
                            allowing recurring user needs to guide me in my brainstorming. Instead of formal 
                            exercises like Crazy 8s, <strong>I opted for a more fluid and iterative approach:</strong> sketching 
                            rough ideas whenever inspiration hit. This allowed me to explore a variety of potential 
                            features in a more organic way, focusing on solving specific pain points such as 
                            customization, speed, and simplicity. By keeping the focus on real, everyday user 
                            struggles, I was able to come up with ideas that felt both useful and genuinely thoughtful.</p>

                        <div id="paper-wireframe-paragraphs">

                            <p>I chose to start with the homepage because it sets the tone for the entire user experience. 
                                It’s the first impression and a key factor in encouraging users to engage with the app. I explored 
                                several variations, experimenting with layout, hierarchy, and content. For each version, I starred 
                                elements that resonated most, whether it was the structure, visual flow, or clarity of information. 
                                I then combined these strongest aspects into a final paper wireframe, creating a homepage that 
                                balanced functionality with a welcoming and intuitive design.

                            <p>After sketching out a paper wireframe I was happy with, I started building a digital version. 
                                This helped me clean things up, get a better feel for spacing and flow, and bring the layout 
                                closer to how it might actually look on a screen.</p>

                                <p>After finalizing the wireframes, I started linking everything together in Figma to map out the main user flow. 
                                I focused on the checkout process: how someone would add something to their cart and actually complete an order. 
                                It was a simple way to test how the screens worked together and whether the flow made sense before moving on to 
                                any visuals or details.</p>

                                sure all the key screens connected logically. Since the design was still basic, I concentrated on structure and user
                                flow rather than visuals or detailed content, which helped keep the focus on functionality first.</p>

                                <p>When creating the high-fidelity prototype, I built on everything I learned from the low-fidelity version 
                                    and the usability feedback it generated. I revisited each screen with fresh eyes, making changes 
                                    to the flow, visuals, and microcopy. For example, I adjusted some of the wording on buttons and labels to
                                    make them clearer, and I incorporated real images, colors, and branding elements. I also added more visual hierarchy to key elements, like call-to-action buttons 
                                    and so on. The high-fidelity prototype became a much more realistic version of the final product, allowing me 
                                    to test not just the functionality, but also how the design felt in a user-world context.</p>

                            <p><strong>The first</strong> prototype did not include a full menu, and users found that confusing. After the usability study, I 
                                decided to add a full menu option as well, so users can see everything the bakery has to offer on one page.</p>
                            <p><strong>The second</strong> usability study revealed the difficulty in customizations when the font become too small, which makes 
                                the customization process more difficult. I redesigned the selection process to be a dropdown menu.</p>

                        <p>After building the high-fidelity prototype, I tested it with several users to see how well the flow held up in real-world use. I asked participants 
                        to go through key tasks like placing an order or checking out, and I paid close attention to where they hesitated or got confused. Some feedback 
                        confirmed things were working well, while other parts, like button placement or unclear labels, needed refining. These testing sessions helped me 
                        catch small usability issues I might have missed on my own, and they shaped the final tweaks I made before wrapping up the design.</p>
